## 🧾 Scope of Work Implemented

### **1. Data Extraction**
The scripts extract complete data for each brand, model, and variant:
- Specifications (engine, transmission, horsepower, drivetrain, dimensions)
- Features (Safety, Interior, Exterior, Measurements, General Features)
- Prices (AED/SAR)
- Image URLs (featured + full gallery)
- All trims/variants per model
- 100% coverage for UAE & KSA markets

---

### **2. Data Structuring**
Processed into the exact schema required by YaaraCars upload sheets:
- **Brands**
- **Models**
- **Variants**
- **Feature Sheets**  
  - Safety  
  - Interior  
  - Exterior  
  - Measurements  
  - Features  

Includes:
- Correct column names
- Correct column ordering
- Slug formatting (no spaces / no special characters)
- Variant_ID coordination for feature sheets
- Validation against empty rows, missing fields, duplicates

---

### **3. Automated Upload to YaaraCars Admin**
The upload workflow strictly follows the required upload sequence:

1. **Brands**
2. **Models**
3. **Variants**
4. **Features (all 5 sheets)**

The automation scripts:
- Log in using provided credentials
- Upload each sheet
- Validate success messages
- Detect any errors or empty rows
- Ensure all uploaded data appears correctly in the system
